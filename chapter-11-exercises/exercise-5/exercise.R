# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `"nycflights13"` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library("nycflights13")
library("dplyr")

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
dep_delay_by_month <- flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
dep_delay_by_month

# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
max_ave <- filter(dep_delay_by_month, delay == max(delay)) %>% select(month)

# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay"
# in that order), you can create a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the
# `plot()` function
plot(dep_delay_by_month)

# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows
des_delay <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(-delay)
head(des_delay)
  

# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!
filter(airports, faa == des_delay$dest[1])
View(airports)

# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
city_fast <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(avg_spd = mean(distance/air_time * 60), na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  filter(avg_spd == max(avg_spd, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(dest)
city_fast
